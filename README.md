# flavorhood-app
FlavorHood is a recipe app that keeps track of all your recipes. It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of them, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you to make them public to anyone.
